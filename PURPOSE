Description: test desk performance fio
Author: Mingrui Zhang <mizhang@redhat.com>

To measure disk performance on a sigle machine, including
read/write/rand_read/rand_write/rand_read_write bandwidth,
we may use fio for such prepose.

This test case may help run fio disk performance test,
compare with previous result, and analyze result into
a csv file by setting parameters.


Parameters:
    BASELINE  :baseline kernel version, like  3.10.0-1062.el7,
               default current kernel
    TARGET    :target   kernel version, like  4.18.0-80.el8  ,
               default current kernel

    BASELINE and TARGET parameters are default to be current kernel nvr

If not given certain BASELINE and TARGET parameters, this script
  will only run fio test under current system enviroment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Explaination:
      If only run test (most likely when current task is the
      initial of all tasks sequence) not provide any parameters,
      or set BASELINE and TARGET as same
       For example:
        Only run test. No set parameters
        ./runtest.sh

      If the purpose is run test and compare to previous result
      then must give nvr as parameter for the object to compare,
      no matter current task is baseline or target.
       For example:
        If current kernel version is 4.18.0-80.el8
        and tests on 3.10.0-1062.el7 have just finished. Then
        compare current test with previous result,
        3.10.0-1062.el7 is baseline, 4.18.0-80.el8 is target.
        Set BASELINE=3.10.0-1062.el7  , then it would like
        BASELINE=3.10.0-1062.el7 ./runtest.sh

        If current kernel version is 3.10.0-1062.el7
        and tests on 4.18.0-80.el8 have just finished. Then
        compare current test with previous result,
        3.10.0-1062.el7 is baseline, 4.18.0-80.el8 is target.
        Set TARGET=4.18.0-80.el8 , then it would like
        TARGET=4.18.0-80.el8 ./runtest.sh
